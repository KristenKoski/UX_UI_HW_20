<p>
This redesign was a collaborative effort between three designers. We undertook the task of redesigning the website of Presentation Manor Senior Living, a cherished non-profit committed to caring for the elderly and proving a welcoming space they can call home. Throughout our collaboration, we recognized the importance of designing a website that spoke to Presentation Manor’s core values and allowed prospective residents and their families to easily locate information</p>

                <p>Additionally, they needed their website to meet accessibility standards in order to provide equal access to all users</p>

<!--Problem Statement col-->
    <div>
        <h2 id="secondaryHeaders">Problem Statement</h2>
        <br>
        <p> The Presentation Manor Senior Living Website was designed with the goal of providing <strong>easy access to information related to services, amenities, pricing, room availability, and detailed descriptions of facilities and programs </strong>for prospective residents and their families across all age demographics</p>
        <p> However, we have observed that our website is not meeting these objectives, <strong>our users are struggling to access comprehensive information and detailed descriptions of amenities, services, and pricing offered by Presentation Manor.</strong> The lack of accessible information is resulting in <strong>infrequent bookings and a hesitancy among prospective residents in applying to Presentation Manor </strong> </p>
        <p> How can we improve our website to address these issues and <strong>achieve key success metrics such as increasing booked tours to showcase a robust digital presence, boosting user visits, and fostering greater family involvement and connectivity? </strong></p>
