<p>
This redesign was a collaborative effort between three designers. We undertook the task of redesigning the website of Presentation Manor Senior Living, a cherished non-profit committed to caring for the elderly and proving a welcoming space they can call home. Throughout our collaboration, we recognized the importance of designing a website that spoke to Presentation Manor’s core values and allowed prospective residents and their families to easily locate information</p>

        <p> We interviewed a diverse range of individuals aged 40-75. Participants are researching senior living communities for themselves or their aging parents. They require a thorough understanding of floor plans, amenities, services, and pricing transparency to inform their decision</p>

                <p>Additionally, they needed their website to meet accessibility standards in order to provide equal access to all users</p>

<!--Problem Statement col-->
    <div>
        <h2 id="secondaryHeaders">Problem Statement</h2>
        <br>
        <p> The Presentation Manor Senior Living Website was designed with the goal of providing <strong>easy access to information related to services, amenities, pricing, room availability, and detailed descriptions of facilities and programs </strong>for prospective residents and their families across all age demographics</p>
        <p> However, we have observed that our website is not meeting these objectives, <strong>our users are struggling to access comprehensive information and detailed descriptions of amenities, services, and pricing offered by Presentation Manor.</strong> The lack of accessible information is resulting in <strong>infrequent bookings and a hesitancy among prospective residents in applying to Presentation Manor </strong> </p>
        <p> How can we improve our website to address these issues and <strong>achieve key success metrics such as increasing booked tours to showcase a robust digital presence, boosting user visits, and fostering greater family involvement and connectivity? </strong></p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h1 id="mainHeaders"> Ideate</h1>
        <p> We delved into structuring the website to enhance user interactions. Our aim was to craft an intuitive digital environment that users could seamlessly navigate</p>
        <h2 id="secondaryHeaders">Sitemap</h2>

<!--Iterations-->
       <div>
        <h1 id="mainHeaders"> Test</h1>
        <h2 id="secondaryHeaders">Homepage Iterations</h2>
        <p> Usability testing revealed that the amount of content on the homepage was overwhelming and a few users suggested that we adjust the hierarchy of the ‘Book a Tour’ button to emphasize its importance</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
                <img id="iteration1" src="./Images/Iteration 1.png">

            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p> We “hid” excess content by showcase only essential information pertaining to the care options offered. We introduced a 'care type quiz' to provide visitors with the flexibility of delving deeper into each service</p>
    </div> 

    <div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column">

                <img id="iteration4" src="./Images/iteration4.png">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>We refined the 'Book a Tour' button, enhancing its visibility and underlining its significance to users. We opted to rename it 'Schedule Tour', to better align with the scheduling functionality offered</p>
